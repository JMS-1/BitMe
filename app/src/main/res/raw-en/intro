Here you can prove your experience with the binary representation of numbers. The order of the bits of a random number between 1 and $$MAX$$ will be changed and displayed - with bit 0 at the very bottom. You may shift each bit to the left or right to remove it and put it back as the topmost bit. So after some time you may reach the goal and reconstruct the correct bit order of the random number.

The random number is shown in the title bar. In addition on the top right position a count shows the minimum number of bit changes needed to get to the correct order. Symbols right to the title allow you to restart the game with a new or even the same number.
